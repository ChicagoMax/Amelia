AMELIA MORROW

    </div>
<body>
    <p> Amelia Morrow is an American born artist, actress/singer/dancer, and gymnast.
        Born in Evanston, Il., she was raised in Chicago's Rogers Park neighborhood where she was influenced
    by the neighborhood's ethnic diversity.     </p>

    <p>In 2018, Amelia's athletic pursuits led her to compete in Chicago Park District 
        "City Wide" gymnastics meet. She had placed fifth overall and 
        third in the beam in her regional meet.  
    </p>
    <p>Artistically, Amelia continues to pursue multi-media projects.  Her installation pieces include 
        original drawings and sculptures creating an atmosphere that transports the observer to a nostalgic Americana. 
        In "Cozy Corner", we step inside a modern day Robert Frank photograph, reminding us of the comforts of the neighborhood diner.
